## Introduction
The Robot Control System is designed to manage and control robotic operations efficiently. This system includes various modules and communication protocols to ensure seamless interaction between different components.

## Features
- **USART Communication**: Establishes communication between the microcontroller and the mini-PC.
- **Real-Time Operating System**: Developed using FreeRTOS for efficient task management.
- **CAN Communication**: Integrates CAN protocol for Servo motor (Cubemars).
- **I2C and SDA Communication**: Enables communication with the microcontroller.

## Installation
To get started with the Robot Control System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MahadiAlif/Robot-Control-System.git
